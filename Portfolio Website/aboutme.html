							<p class="paragraph-magda">Hello! <br />Hello, my name is Magda and I would like to start off with saying that I am self-taught which means I have started learning programming by myself. I did not learn it at school, since I have chosen ICT instead of IT (ICT is basically nothing to do with coding, my teacher said it would be the best option at the end of year 8 or 9 since I was pretty creative at designing things.) and since then I have regretted my choice. Therefore I have started learning on my own. So I have been interested in programming since I was 13 years old. Since my older brother made some programs in <strong> C++ </strong> I also wanted to do the same. However I learned the basic variables, then I got frustrated because I could not solve a problem and I've put off my learning until I was 15 years old.
							<br /> <br/ > When I was 15 I have came back to learning how to program, the first programming language was... <strong> C++ </strong>. I have learned the pure basics to just get me up and running, and then I have done some win32 console applications and <strong>stopped</strong>. I have stopped since I wanted to do something more, I wanted to make websites therefore I have learned HTML and CSS, then went on to JQuery (which is a library of Javascript) as I wanted to make more <strong>dynamic</strong> websites. Right now I am still learning, however instead of continuing with me learning Javascript; I have chosen to take on another language instead, which happens to be Java since I have put it off for few weeks; as I was afraid I would have a hard time understanding it since it is all object-oriented programming language. Unlike C++ in which I did nothing to do with OOP but instead I felt like procedural programming is easier. Right now (05/01/17) I know the core basics of java and the basic concept of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) also I have looked at arrays( which I thought were complicated, turns out they are not) and I will continue to learn java for now and see how it goes. <br/> <br/>
							So far how I am learning is mostly read few pages of a book about a particular programming language so I will get familiar with it. Then afterwards if I have an idea of what program or website I would like to make, I use google (as my search engine) to know how to do something e.g. if I want to find out how to change a colour of a certain sentance I would type in "css change text colour"; however if I do not have any ideas of what to make I just keep on reading the book or watch some youtube tutorials. Moreover if I am new to a certain programming language I sometimes go on youtube and watch some tutorials on it or e.g. "lean java in 30 minutes" just to get myself familiar with the syntax etc. as I know that I will not retrive most information which was in the video therefore it is useful to just simply get familiar with the syntax etc.
							<br/> <br/>
							My plan for the future would be to work as a programmer if I will get good enough as I am enjoying it very much; and I feel like I could be doing it for the rest of my life even though it gets hard sometimes if my program does not compile and I cannot fix it for few hours, however I always find the solution on google or some other search engine, as I cannot stop thinking about the ways to fix it therefore I can sit for hours and search for a solution (I am very determined if I want to fix something).</p>
